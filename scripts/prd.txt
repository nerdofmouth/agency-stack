- Consolidate and deduplicate overlapping logic or documentation.
- Update documentation to accurately reflect current workflows, TDD, and operational discipline.
- Validate all install scripts and Makefile targets for idempotency and auditability.
- Ensure all changes are repository-tracked and follow the proper change workflow.
- Prepare a summary report of findings and next steps.
