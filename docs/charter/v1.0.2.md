# ðŸ§  AgencyStack Charter v1.0.2 (Full Synthesis)

## 1. Purpose & Mission
AgencyStack (Upstack.agency) is a sovereign, auditable, and repeatable infrastructure platform for small agencies, creators, and co-ops. It enables secure, multi-tenant, AI-enhanced, and customizable deploymentsâ€”spanning foundational infrastructure, business productivity, communication, and AI-driven SaaSâ€”using only repository-tracked, idempotent, and documented workflows.

## 2. Core Principles
- **Repository as Source of Truth:** All installation, configuration, and operational logic must be defined and tracked in the repository. Never modify live VMs directly.
- **Idempotency & Automation:** All scripts, Makefile targets, and Docker builds must be rerunnable without harmful side effects.
- **Auditability & Documentation:** Every component, script, and workflow must be documented in human-readable markdown in `/docs/pages/components/` and referenced in this Charter. Logs are stored under `/var/log/agency_stack/components/`.
- **Sovereignty:** No dependency on external services unless explicitly enabled. All critical infrastructure is self-hosted and reproducible.
- **Multi-Tenancy & Security:** Default to tenant isolation, strong authentication (Keycloak SSO), and strict resource boundaries. TLS is required for all networked services.
- **Strategic Alignment:** All work must map to the current AgencyStack roadmap and phase objectives, from infrastructure to AI-driven SaaS and public launch.
- **Proper Change Workflow:** All changes must be made in the local repo, tested, committed, and deployed only via tracked scripts or Makefile targets. No manual or post-hoc fixes.
- **Component Consistency:** Every installable component must have: a tracked install script, Makefile targets, docs, registry entry, and logs.
- **Debugging Discipline:** Extract configs from VMs, fix in repo, document, and redeploy. Never patch VMs directly.
- **WSL2/Docker Mount Safety:** All Docker volume mounts must be rigorously validated to ensure file vs. directory type consistency. Never assume Docker will correctly handle a file vs. directory mismatch.

## 3. Directory & File Structure
| Purpose | Path |
|--------|------|
| Install scripts | `/scripts/components/` |
| Utility scripts | `/scripts/utils/` |
| Mock/test code | `/scripts/mock/` |
| Component docs | `/docs/pages/components/` |
| Logs | `/var/log/agency_stack/components/<component>.log` |
| Install output | `/opt/agency_stack/clients/${CLIENT_ID}/<component>/` |

Never write to `/usr`, `$HOME`, or system paths unless explicitly instructed.

## 4. Installation & Change Workflow
1. Make changes ONLY to the local repository.
2. Test locally where possible.
3. Commit changes with descriptive messages.
4. Transfer changes to remote VMs ONLY through:
   - Git pull from authorized repositories
   - Official installation scripts
   - Makefile targets
5. Document all behavior and changes in the repo.
6. When debugging, extract configs from VMs, fix in the repo, document, and redeploy.
7. All fixes must be incorporated into the codebase for future deployments.
8. For Docker/WSL environments, all file validations must explicitly check for and handle file vs. directory conflicts.

## 5. Dev Container Build & Customization Policy
- All dev containers are built from `Dockerfile.dev`, orchestrated by `scripts/utils/create_base_docker_dev.sh`.
- Custom themes, shells, and tools are version-controlled and installed during build (never post-hoc inside running containers).
- Default shell and prompt branding (e.g., AgencyStack Oh My Zsh theme) are set in the Dockerfile.
- Any customization must be documented and referenced in this Charter.

**Instruction:**
> When updating the dev container environment, always:
> - Add new tools, shells, or themes to `Dockerfile.dev`.
> - Place custom themes or configs (e.g., `custom-themes/agency-jonathan.zsh-theme`) in the repository.
> - Use `scripts/utils/create_base_docker_dev.sh` to build and run the container.
> - Never make changes directly inside a running container that are not reflected in the repo.

## 6. Makefile & Component Registry Standards
- Every component must have Makefile targets: `make <component>`, `make <component>-status`, `make <component>-logs`, `make <component>-restart`, `make <component>-test` (optional).
- All installable components must be tracked in `component_registry.json` with accurate flags and metadata (including SSO, monitoring, multi_tenant, etc).
- SSO-enabled components must integrate with Keycloak and document their configuration. Add `sso_configured: true` only after live integration is tested.
- All networked ports must be documented in `/docs/pages/ports.md` and reflected in the registry.

## 7. Documentation & Auditability
- All new features, fixes, and customizations must be documented in `/docs/pages/components/` and referenced in this Charter.
- Use `/scripts/utils/` helpers for logging, validation, and registry updates.
- Component documentation must include: Purpose, Paths, Logs, Ports, Restart methods, Security details.
- Mock/test scripts (`/scripts/mock/`) are required for UI/LLM components.

## 8. Security, SSO, & Testing
- Default to secure, tenant-isolated, and TLS-enabled deployments.
- Keycloak SSO is required for all `sso: true` components, with tenant-isolated realms if multi-tenant.
- Install scripts must accept flags such as `--enable-keycloak`, `--enable-cloud`, `--enable-openai`, and fail loudly if dependencies are missing.
- Run `make alpha-check` and full-stack validation after any major change.
- Use mock scripts and test modes for disruptive components.
- All logs, health checks, and validation results must be human-readable and stored for audit.
- All component install scripts must log to `/var/log/agency_stack/components/<component>.log` and source `common.sh` for logging/safety.

## 9. Strategic Roadmap Alignment
- All implementation and debugging work must align with the current roadmap phases (see `ðŸš€ Upstack.agency Strategic Project Roadmap`).
- Prioritize foundational infrastructure, then business/productivity, then AI/agentic tooling, then public launch.
- Integrate and document advanced AI/agentic tools (bolt.diy, Archon) as per phase requirements.
- All phases must be validated by: clean install, SSO, dashboard, logs, and health checks.

## 10. Docker Volume Mounts & WSL2 Compatibility Rules
- All Docker volume mounts must explicitly validate source and target types (file vs. directory).
- Install scripts MUST explicitly remove any existing directory at file mount points before container startup.
- Use validation helpers like:
  ```bash
  validate_mount_point() {
    if [ -d "$1" ]; then 
      echo "ERROR: $1 is a directory but should be a file. Docker mount will fail."
      rm -rf "$1"
    fi
  }
  ```
- In WSL2 environments, prefer git-based deployment over direct volume mounts when possible.
- For critical configs that must be file mounts, validate before AND after file creation.
- Document all volume mount validation in install scripts with clear comments.
- Container removal and recreation must be explicit when volume mount issues are detected.

## 11. Final Checks & Success Criteria
- System must install cleanly on a fresh Docker-enabled VM or WSL2 instance using only Makefile and repo-defined scripts.
- All critical components (core, traefik, keycloak, dashboard, wordpress, voip) must be accessible and verifiable.
- All logs and health checks must be visible and pass.
- No manual fixes or undocumented changes allowed.
- All artifacts (logs, `.installed_ok`, registry, etc) must be tracked and auditable.
- Docker volume mount points must be verified before declaring installation success.

**This v1.0.2 Charter supersedes previous versions. All contributors and workflow agents must adhere to these principles for every commit, deployment, and test.**
