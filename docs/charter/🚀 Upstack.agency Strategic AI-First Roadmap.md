# üöÄ Upstack.agency Strategic AI-First Roadmap

## Executive Summary

AgencyStack (Upstack.agency) is evolving into a sovereign, auditable, and AI-enhanced infrastructure platform following the Charter v1.0.3 principles. This roadmap prioritizes AI capabilities from Phase 1, ensuring that AI development tools are integrated directly into the foundational infrastructure.

## AI-First Strategy Principles

1. **AI Sovereignty**: All AI components must be self-hosted and containerized
2. **Repository as Source of Truth**: All AI models, configurations, and operational logic tracked in repository
3. **Multi-Tenant AI**: Default to tenant isolation for AI services and model deployments
4. **Containerized AI**: All AI services strictly containerized with proper resource boundaries
5. **Observable AI**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring for all AI operations
