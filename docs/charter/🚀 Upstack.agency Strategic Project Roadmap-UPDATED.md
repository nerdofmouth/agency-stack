## 🔄 Alignment with AgencyStack Charter v1.0.3

This roadmap aligns with the following core principles from the AgencyStack Charter:

- **Repository as Source of Truth**: All installation, configuration, and operational logic must be defined and tracked in the repository. Never modify live VMs directly.
- **Idempotency & Automation**: All scripts, Makefile targets, and Docker builds must be rerunnable without harmful side effects.
- **Auditability & Documentation**: Every component, script, and workflow must be documented in human-readable markdown in `/docs/pages/components/` and referenced in this Charter. Logs are stored under `/var/log/agency_stack/components/`.
- **Sovereignty**: No dependency on external services unless explicitly enabled. All critical infrastructure is self-hosted and reproducible.
- **Multi-Tenancy & Security**: Default to tenant isolation, strong authentication (Keycloak SSO), and strict resource boundaries. TLS is required for all networked services.
- **Strategic Alignment**: All work must map to the current AgencyStack roadmap and phase objectives, from infrastructure to AI-driven SaaS and public launch.


## 🧠 MCP Server & Context7 Integration Strategy

### Current Implementation Status

The MCP Server now includes an integrated Context7 module that follows these Charter principles:

1. **Repository as Source of Truth**: All Context7 implementation code is contained in the repository under `/scripts/components/mcp/context7-impl.js`
2. **Strict Containerization**: Context7 functionality runs within the MCP server container with proper isolation
3. **Component Consistency**: The implementation includes proper documentation, Makefile targets, and logging
4. **Auditability**: All operations through Context7 are logged and traceable

### Next Steps for Integration

1. **Network Diagnostics Enhancement**:
   - Implement comprehensive container networking validation
   - Add Traefik integration for secure service discovery
   - Document all network configurations in `/docs/pages/components/network.md`

2. **WordPress Validation Integration**:
   - Enhance HTTP-WP-validator to leverage Context7 for deployment validation
   - Implement TDD Protocol compliance tests
   - Create automated validation workflows

3. **Taskmaster Enhancements**:
   - Integrate strategic planning capabilities
   - Add Charter compliance verification to deployment workflows
   - Create comprehensive logging and auditing mechanisms

## 🔗 Strategic Integration Projects

### 1. bolt.diy

**Overview:** bolt.diy provides a containerized LLM development environment that enhances AgencyStack's AI capabilities while maintaining sovereignty and security.
