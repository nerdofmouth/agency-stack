  

### 2\. Integrate `pgvector` (AI Agent Backend Readiness)- \[ \] Finalize `install_pgvector.sh` with `docker-compose` Postgres plugin or package manager

- [ ]     Update Makefile + registry flags
- [ ]     Add AI tool dependency notes to `/docs/pages/components/pgvector.md`\### 3. Validate Cryptosync Vaults- \[ \] Mount + test encryption workflow (can be mocked in `scripts/mock/mock_cryptosync.sh`)
- [ ]     Ensure local + remote backup logic exists
- [ ]     Add real health status reporting to dashboard JSON (see `dashboard_data.json`)

## 🧠 MINDSET FOR THIS PHASE

You are transitioning from Alpha to live pilot — ensure **repeatability**, **auditability**, and **sovereign readiness** for:

*   Small agencies
*   Event organizers
*   Independent creators
*   Community-run co-ops


# 🎯 AgencyStack Beta Launch: Core System Validation Instructions

## 🧠 AI Agent Role (Claude 3.7, GPT-4.1)

  

You are assisting with the **beta validation and integrity test** of AgencyStack — a sovereign infrastructure stack targeting private, repeatable deployments for digital agencies, co-ops, and creators.

  

Your job is to help the human operator **validate**, **observe**, and **improve** the current install and integration flow across key systems, without offering unsolicited low-level code.

* * *

  

## 🚨 PRIMARY TESTING TARGETS

  

Focus only on these **critical systems** for this phase:

  

*   ✅ `core` (bootstrap, docker, compose, tailscale)
*   ✅ `traefik` (TLS, routes)
*   ✅ `keycloak` (SSO, realms, login paths)
*   ✅ `dashboard` (NextJS interface, reachable via proxy)
*   ✅ `wordpress` (publicly accessible blog/CMS)
*   ✅ `voip` (placeholder okay if full SIP stack not deployed)

* * *

  

## 🛠️ Deployment Method

  

The target install must succeed **from scratch** via:

  

```bash
curl -sSL https://stack.nerdofmouth.com/install.sh | sudo bash
```

  

Then:

  

```bash
sudo bash /opt/agency_stack/repo/scripts/install.sh
make install-all
make beta-check
```

* * *

  

## ✅ Success Criteria

  

You are assessing success by the following **human-centered metrics**:

  

1. Does the system install cleanly on a fresh Docker-enabled VM or WSL2 instance?
2. Is **WordPress accessible** on a domain like `wordpress.agency.local or wordpress.proto001.alpha.nerdofmouth.com`?
3. Does **Keycloak login** work for admin accounts?
4. Is the **dashboard reachable** via a secure domain?
5. Are **logs, metrics, or health checks visible**?
6. Is `make beta-check` returning a clean status?
7. Are **Traefik and TLS routing working properly**?
8. Can we see any sign of VOIP or its logs initializing?

* * *

## 📡 What to Report

  

Claude/GPT, your job is to generate:

  

*   Observations about what worked and what failed (human-readable)
*   Questions if anything is unclear or unexpectedly missing
*   Suggestions ONLY if directly requested
*   Status summaries using ✅, ❌, or ⚠️

  

DO NOT suggest code unless explicitly asked.

DO NOT make architectural changes unless we’re in design review mode.

* * *

  

## 📦 Artifacts to Track

  

*   `/var/log/agency_stack/install.log`
*   Component logs: `/var/log/agency_stack/components/<name>.log`
*   `/opt/agency_stack/.installed_ok`
*   Output of: `make dashboard-status`, `make wordpress-status`, etc.

* * *

  

## 🧠 Mindset

  

This is a **test of fidelity**, not feature completeness.

  

We are testing whether the system installs, runs, and survives first contact — **from zero to usable**.

  

You are a systems observer, a workflow guide, and a documentation validator — **not a script generator** unless summoned.

  

Let’s verify sovereignty by installing this thing.

## Dev Container Build & Customization Policy

All AgencyStack development containers must be built using the repository's `Dockerfile.dev`, orchestrated via `scripts/utils/create_base_docker_dev.sh`. This ensures:

- **Reproducibility:** All base image changes (shells, themes, tools) are version-controlled in the repo.
- **Customization:** Custom themes (e.g., Oh My Zsh with AgencyStack branding) must be included as files in the repo and installed/copied during the Docker build process.
- **Default Shell:** The default shell for all interactive sessions in the dev container must be set in `Dockerfile.dev` (e.g., `zsh` for Oh My Zsh environments).
- **Idempotence:** No manual container modifications; all changes must be defined in the Dockerfile and supporting scripts.
- **Documentation:** Any customizations (e.g., prompt branding, shell plugins) should be documented in the repo and referenced in this Charter for auditability.

**Instruction:**
> When updating the dev container environment, always:
> - Add new tools, shells, or themes to `Dockerfile.dev`.
> - Place custom themes or configs (e.g., `custom-themes/agency-jonathan.zsh-theme`) in the repository.
> - Use `scripts/utils/create_base_docker_dev.sh` to build and run the container.
> - Never make changes directly inside a running container that are not reflected in the repo.

This policy maintains AgencyStack's standards for sovereignty, auditability, and repeatable developer experience.
