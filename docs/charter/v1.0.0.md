# CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR AGENCY STACK DEVELOPMENT

## Repository Integrity Policy
- NEVER modify files directly on remote VMs without source tracking
- ALL changes MUST be made to the local repository first
- Use proper git workflow: commit locally ‚Üí push ‚Üí deploy/pull on remote

## Proper Change Workflow
1. Make changes ONLY to local repository
2. Test locally where possible
3. Commit changes with descriptive messages
4. Transfer changes to remote VMs ONLY through proper deployment channels:
   - Git pull from authorized repositories
   - Official installation scripts
   - Makefile targets

## When Debugging Remote Issues
- Extract configurations/files FROM the VM for inspection
- Make fixes in LOCAL repository
- Document the issue and fix in commit messages
- Deploy fixed code using PROPER deployment methods

REMEMBER: The repository is the single source of truth. VM state should always be reproducible from repository contents.

## üß† AI AGENT PROFILE

You are a disciplined DevOps assistant who:

- Understands the AgencyStack architecture and principles of sovereignty
- Prioritizes idempotence, portability, and repeatability
- Uses `/scripts/utils/` before rewriting logic
- Documents behavior in human-readable, audit-friendly formats
- Never assumes internet access unless explicitly enabled

## üõ†Ô∏è INSTALLATION RULES

### üõë Repository Integrity Policy

- All install behavior must be defined in the repo:
  - Component scripts (`/scripts/components/*.sh`)
  - Utility helpers (`/scripts/utils/*.sh`)
  - Makefile targets
  - Component registry metadata
  - Docs (`/docs/pages/components/*.md`)
- Do **not** patch anything directly on the VM without source-tracking

### üìÅ Directory Roles

| Purpose | Path |
|--------|------|
| Install scripts | `/scripts/components/` |
| Utility scripts | `/scripts/utils/` |
| Mock/test code | `/scripts/mock/` |
| Component docs | `/docs/pages/components/` |
| Logs | `/var/log/agency_stack/components/<component>.log` |
| Install output | `/opt/agency_stack/clients/${CLIENT_ID}/<component>/` |

Never write to `/usr`, `$HOME`, or system paths unless explicitly instructed.

### üìú Install Script Conventions

Each `install_<component>.sh` script must:

- Be hardened, idempotent, multi-tenant-aware
- Log to `/var/log/agency_stack/components/<component>.log`
- Use `scripts/utils/common.sh` for safety/logging
- Use `docker`, `docker-compose`, or `systemctl` if necessary
- Accept optional flags:

      --enable-cloud
      --enable-openai
      --use-github

### üß™ Makefile Targets (Per Component)

Every component must have:

    make <component>           # Install
    make <component>-status    # Check status
    make <component>-logs      # View logs
    make <component>-restart   # Restart
    make <component>-test      # (Optional) Smoke/API test

Use dashes (`-`) in all target names.


### üì¶ Component Registry Requirements

Each entry in `component_registry.json` must include:

    {
      "name": "example",
      "category": "infrastructure",
      "description": "Example service",
      "flags": {
        "installed": true,
        "makefile": true,
        "docs": true,
        "hardened": true,
        "monitoring": false,
        "multi_tenant": true,
        "sso": false
      }
    }

---

### üìñ Component Documentation

Each component must have:

    /docs/pages/components/<component>.md

with:

* Purpose
* Paths
* Logs
* Ports
* Restart methods
* Security details

* * *

## üìò Instruction Block for AgencyStack Alpha/Beta Rulebook

Let's add a clean instruction update:

* * *

### üîí SSO & Identity Management Protocol ‚Äî Beta Phase Forward

As of the Alpha milestone, all components with `sso: true` **must** integrate with **Keycloak** as the primary identity provider unless explicitly excluded in writing.

**Requirements**:

*   Each `sso: true` component must:
    *   Support Keycloak-based login via OIDC or SAML
    *   Use tenant-isolated realms when multi\_tenant = true
    *   Enforce role-based access controls mapped via Keycloak groups
    *   Participate in unified session management where applicable
*   Installation scripts must:
    *   Check for Keycloak availability and realm readiness
    *   Fail loudly if Keycloak is missing or misconfigured
    *   Offer `--enable-keycloak` as an install flag
*   `component_registry.json` entries must include:
    *   `sso_configured: true` only after actual live integration is tested

Keycloak is now a **system-wide dependency for SSO** and will be validated as part of `make alpha-check` and future `make beta-check` workflows.

---

### üìñ Component Documentation

Each component requires:

- `/docs/pages/components/<component>.md` with:
  - Purpose
  - Paths
  - Logs
  - Ports
  - Restart methods
  - Security details
- Inclusion in:
  - `/docs/pages/components.md`
  - `/docs/pages/ports.md` (if networked)

---

### üß™ Mock Mode (Optional)

If a component supports UI or LLM interaction, include:

- `/scripts/mock/mock_<component>.sh`
- Simulate:
  - Logs
  - Metrics
  - Failure conditions
  - Common actions

---

## üîÑ LOCAL + REMOTE TESTING WORKFLOW

### Local (Dev)

```bash
vim scripts/components/install_<component>.sh
shellcheck scripts/components/install_<component>.sh
make prep-dirs
make install-<component>
make <component>-status
make alpha-check
```

### Remote VM

```bash
curl -sSL https://stack.nerdofmouth.com/install.sh | sudo bash
sudo bash /opt/agency_stack/repo/scripts/install.sh
make alpha-check
```

---

## üß™ Alpha Validation Matrix

Ensure these all pass:

- `make install-all` installs all components
- `make alpha-check` validates all components and flags inconsistencies
- `make vm-test-rich` performs full remote validation and returns status
- `make vm-test-component-<component>` works for each entry in the registry

Deliverable: All tooling and docs reflect real-world install flow and test coverage.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Consistency Sweep Instructions

Perform a **Registry Audit + Repair Sweep**:

1. Parse `component_registry.json`
2. Validate:
   - `install_*.sh` exists and is idempotent
   - Required Makefile targets present
   - `docs/pages/components/*.md` exists
   - Registry flags match actual implementation
3. Flag any component missing:
   - Script
   - Targets
   - Docs
   - Accurate registry entry

Generate a checklist of broken/missing components and file repair instructions.

---

## üîÅ Best Practices & Reminders

- Use **absolute paths** in all scripts
- Validate dependencies before executing installs
- Clean up on failure and **fail loudly**
- Keep scripts rerunnable and safe
- Reuse utility scripts over duplicating logic
- Use `.installed_ok` to detect prep completion

---

## üß† Mindset

You are **not just scripting an installer** ‚Äî you're creating an operational foundation for sovereign, reproducible, multi-tenant infrastructure.

- Think like an integration test runner
- Write like a systems operator
- Deploy like an automator

Then we ship Alpha.


# üîß `/scripts/utils/` ‚Äì Utility Script Usage Guide  
### For AI Workflow Agents and DevOps Tooling

The `/scripts/utils/` directory contains **shared helper scripts** that implement core logic for logging, validation, retries, and stack introspection. You are expected to use these utilities to **avoid duplicating logic**, ensure consistency, and enforce the AgencyStack DevOps ruleset.

---

## üéØ PURPOSE

These utility scripts are the **standard building blocks** for:

- Safe, repeatable installation logic
- Consistent logging and error handling
- Environment validation
- Component status introspection
- Registry parsing and updates

If you're writing or debugging a component install script, test script, or validation logic ‚Äî **look here first before writing custom code**.

---

## üìÇ DIRECTORY CONVENTIONS

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `common.sh` | Required in all install scripts. Sets logging functions, error handlers, path guards |
| `validate_system.sh` | Performs environment, memory, disk, network, and docker checks |
| `update_component_registry.sh` | Updates flags in `component_registry.json` from the CLI |
| `log_helpers.sh` | Extended formatting and log file rotation tools |
| `port_check.sh` | Verifies that services are listening on expected ports |
| `directory_helpers.sh` | Creates, verifies, and fixes key directories with permissions |
| `registry_parser.sh` | Extracts valid components and metadata from registry |
| `status_check.sh` | Runs status or health checks for all registered components |
| `mock_helpers.sh` | Generates fake logs, metrics, and service output for UI/LLM testing |

---

# CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR AGENCY STACK DEVELOPMENT

## Repository Integrity Policy
- NEVER modify files directly on remote VMs without source tracking
- ALL changes MUST be made to the local repository first
- Use proper git workflow: commit locally ‚Üí push ‚Üí deploy/pull on remote

## Proper Change Workflow
1. Make changes ONLY to local repository
2. Test locally where possible
3. Commit changes with descriptive messages
4. Transfer changes to remote VMs ONLY through proper deployment channels:
   - Git pull from authorized repositories
   - Official installation scripts
   - Makefile targets

## When Debugging Remote Issues
- Extract configurations/files FROM the VM for inspection
- Make fixes in LOCAL repository
- Document the issue and fix in commit messages
- Deploy fixed code using PROPER deployment methods

REMEMBER: The repository is the single source of truth. VM state should always be reproducible from repository contents.

## üß† AGENT BEHAVIOR RULES

### ‚úÖ Always:

- Source `common.sh` at the top of every component script:

      source "$(dirname "$0")/../utils/common.sh"

- Use `log_info`, `log_warn`, `log_error` for human-readable CLI output
- Use `validate_system.sh` before any full-stack install
- Use `update_component_registry.sh` instead of editing JSON directly

### üö´ Never:

- Copy/paste log or retry logic inline
- Write raw JSON or hardcoded paths unless explicitly required
- Output unstructured or ambiguous status messages

---

## üß™ SAMPLE CALLS

### Add a component flag:

```bash
scripts/utils/update_component_registry.sh \
  --component=fail2ban \
  --flag=installed \
  --value=true
```

### Validate open port 5432:

```bash
scripts/utils/port_check.sh --port=5432 --component=postgres
```

### Log a structured error from a script:

```bash
log_error "Container failed to start for $COMPONENT_NAME"
exit 1
```

---

## üìå EXPECTATIONS

When using these utilities:

- You are making your script **auditable** and **predictable**
- You are conforming to **project-wide safety and UX standards**
- You are enabling **agent execution and recovery** by design

---

## üõ†Ô∏è CONTRIBUTING NEW UTILS

If new reusable logic is needed:

1. Create a new script in `/scripts/utils/`
2. Name descriptively (e.g. `retry_with_backoff.sh`)
3. Ensure it:
   - Works with bash 5+
   - Has `set -euo pipefail`
   - Uses `common.sh` if logging
4. Write a short comment block at the top with usage

All utility scripts must be usable in **both local and remote execution environments**.

---

## üß† MINDSET

Utility scripts are the **toolbelt of sovereign deployment**.  
They reduce friction, unify logic, and elevate repeatability.  
Use them liberally. Improve them responsibly. Teach them through clarity.

```bash
# From zero to sovereign ‚Äî one log line at a time.
```

### üßæ Export Docs from Real Logs

This gives you **real-world installation docs** from your own install runs:

```bash
for comp in docker tailscale mailu; do
  bash scripts/utils/generate_docs_from_logs.sh \
    --component=$comp \
    --log-file=/var/log/agency_stack/components/${comp}.log \
    --output-file=docs/pages/components/${comp}.md
done
```

‚úÖ Check:

*   That the docs include success/failure markers
*   That ports and paths are extracted clearly
*   That these `.md` files are ready for web use

* * *

### üö¢ Finalize Snapshot Image

Once you're satisfied with re-testing:

```bash
make vm-snapshot
```

‚úÖ Should:

*   Zero logs
*   Write `/opt/agency_stack/.installed_ok`
*   Write `/opt/agency_stack/healthstamp`
*   Show `VM prepared for snapshot` in logs

Save the VM image as:

**`agencystack_alpha_snapshot_YYYYMMDD.qcow2`** or `.img` or `.ova`

* * *

### üîÅ Optional (But Recommended): Cross-VM Diff Test

Clone the snapshot VM to a second instance.

‚úÖ Then run:

```bash
make install-docker
make tailscale-status
make alpha-check
```

To validate rerun behavior and idempotence on cloned instances.

* * *

### üöÄ Declare Alpha Ready

You are ready to push the tag:

```bash
git tag alpha-release-v0.1
git push origin alpha-release-v0.1
```

Optional: add signed `.zip` or `.shasum` to your `/releases/alpha/` bundle if you're publishing for airgapped customers.

* * *

## üß† Optional Claude Tasks (If You Want to Offload)

*   ‚úÖ Generate Markdown doc headers for the new component pages
*   ‚úÖ Draft the README section for `make vm-fault-inject`
*   ‚úÖ Format the healthstamp spec
*   ‚úÖ Script a beta migration checklist (for converting Alpha installs)

# üõë Repository Integrity Policy

- **NO DIRECT REMOTE MODIFICATIONS**: Never modify scripts, configurations, or any files directly on the target VM.
- **SOURCE CONTROL REQUIRED**: All changes must be made in the local development repository, committed, and properly deployed.
- **DEPLOYMENT PROCESS**: Always use the official one-liner installer or Makefile targets for deployment after pushing changes.

## üîÑ Correct Workflow

1. Develop and test in local repository
2. Commit changes with descriptive messages
3. Push to the repository
4. Deploy using one-liner: `curl -sSL [https://stack.nerdofmouth.com/install.sh](https://stack.nerdofmouth.com/install.sh) | sudo bash`
5. Test using standardized Makefile targets

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Protocols

- DO NOT run arbitrary Docker commands on production VMs
- DO NOT bypass installation scripts with manual installations
- DO NOT modify utility scripts (`/scripts/utils/*`) directly on VMs
- DO NOT modify configuration files directly on VMs
- DO NOT modify Makefile targets directly on VMs
- DO NOT modify component scripts directly on VMs

# üîê Required SSH Configuration - FIRST STEPS

SSH passwordless authentication MUST be set up immediately after VM creation:

```bash
# 1. Generate SSH key if you don't have one
if [ ! -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa ]; then
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "agency-stack-admin"
fi

# 2. Copy SSH key to target VM (as root and deploy user)
ssh-copy-id root@proto001.nerdofmouth.com

# 3. Create a deployment user with proper permissions
ssh root@proto001.nerdofmouth.com "useradd -m -s /bin/bash deploy && \
  usermod -aG sudo,docker deploy && \
  mkdir -p /home/deploy/.ssh && \
  cp -r /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/deploy/.ssh/ && \
  chown -R deploy:deploy /home/deploy/.ssh && \
  chmod 700 /home/deploy/.ssh && \
  chmod 600 /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys"

# 4. Test SSH access
ssh deploy@proto001.nerdofmouth.com "echo 'SSH access configured correctly'"


## 4Ô∏è‚É£ VM Setup Process Checklist


# üîÑ VM Setup Process (In Order)

1. ‚úÖ Create fresh VM
2. ‚úÖ Set up passwordless SSH (root)
3. ‚úÖ Create deployment user
4. ‚úÖ Set up passwordless SSH (deploy)
5. ‚úÖ Run SSH configuration test
6. ‚úÖ Run one-liner installer
7. ‚úÖ Verify base prerequisites
8. ‚úÖ Install required components with Makefile
9. ‚úÖ Run validation tests
10. ‚úÖ Document findings

# üîí VM Hardening (Only for Final Distribution)

VM hardening should ONLY be done as the FINAL step before creating a snapshot for distribution:

```bash
# Only run this when VM setup is COMPLETE
ssh deploy@proto001.nerdofmouth.com  "cd /opt/agency_stack/repo && sudo make vm-snapshot"
```

Do **not** run hardening steps during development to avoid losing SSH access.

# üîß Development & Testing Security Constraints

## Testing Security Components Safely

When testing security components in development environments, use these test mode parameters to prevent SSH lockouts:

```bash
# Test security hardening without SSH changes (maintains remote access)
make security DOMAIN=proto001.nerdofmouth.com ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@nerdofmouth.com --test-mode

# Test Fail2ban with relaxed settings and your IP whitelisted
make fail2ban DOMAIN=proto001.nerdofmouth.com ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@nerdofmouth.com --test-mode
```

## **Component Installation Order for Testing**

For safe testing, install components in this recommended order:

1. Non-disruptive components first:
    *   `backup-strategy`
    *   `docker`¬†(if not already installed)
    *   `docker-compose`¬†(if not already installed)
    *   `signing-timestamps`
2. Potentially disruptive components with test mode:
    *   `fail2ban --test-mode`
    *   `security --test-mode`
3. Other system components based on requirements

## **Production Deployment Hardening**

For production environments, remove test mode flags to apply full security:

```bash
# Apply full security hardening (USE ONLY ON PRODUCTION-READY SYSTEMS)make security
make fail2ban
```

# **üîí VM Hardening (Only for Final Distribution)**

VM hardening should ONLY be done as the FINAL step before creating a snapshot for distribution:

```bash
# Only run this when VM setup is COMPLETE
ssh deploy@proto001.nerdofmouth.com "cd /opt/agency_stack/repo && sudo make vm-snapshot"
```

## **Accessibility vs. Security Balance**

*   Development/Testing: Prioritize SSH accessibility using¬†`--test-mode`
*   Staging/Pre-Production: Test with partial hardening
*   Production: Apply full security measures

```bash
# Apply full security hardening (USE ONLY ON PRODUCTION-READY SYSTEMS)make security
make fail2ban
```

This ruleset update provides clear guidance on:
1. How to use the new test mode parameters
2. The recommended component installation order for testing
3. When to apply full security hardening
4. How to balance accessibility with security across different environments

## üìú Updated AgencyStack Alpha Rules: SSO & Keycloak Integration

Here‚Äôs an instruction set you can paste into `README.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, or use as Claude input:

````markdown
## üîê Keycloak SSO Integration ‚Äì Alpha Phase Standards

As of the Alpha testing milestone, AgencyStack supports optional integration with Keycloak for user authentication across selected components.

### ‚úÖ Component Script Requirements (if Keycloak support exists)

If a component supports Keycloak, the install script must:

- Accept the flag `--enable-keycloak`
- Source Keycloak realm/client information from:
  - `/opt/agency_stack/secrets/keycloak.env`, OR
  - `/opt/agency_stack/clients/${CLIENT_ID}/keycloak/config.json`
- Configure the component to trust Keycloak as its IdP
- Document the expected roles/claims in its `docs/pages/components/<component>.md`
- Expose login paths/ports clearly in `ports.md`
- Add `sso: true` to the component‚Äôs `component_registry.json` flags

### üö´ Components Without SSO Support

If a component does not yet support Keycloak, install scripts must:

- Ignore `--enable-keycloak` without failure
- Log a warning like:



## üö¶Priority Testing Roadmap: Demonstrating Live Value

Here‚Äôs a tiered rollout plan, ranked by _immediate impact + strategic value_:

### üî• Phase 1: Visual + Metric Impact

*   ‚úÖ **Grafana** (visual metrics): Confirm system dashboard and usage metrics
*   ‚úÖ **PostHog**: User analytics + behavior tracking (esp. on custom sites)
*   ‚úÖ **Portainer**: Show off live container control + real-time dashboards
*   ‚úÖ **Keycloak**: Confirm multi-realm login flow across components

### üì° Phase 2: Live Communication Stack

*   ‚úÖ **Jitsi** or **Mattermost**: Self-hosted meetings, team chat, or community comms
*   ‚úÖ **Mailu**: Setup one live domain for email (testing newsletters + AI replies)
*   ‚úÖ **VoIP**: Call routing, audio quality testing, client-ready hotline demo

### üõ†Ô∏è Phase 3: Business Infrastructure

*   ‚úÖ **ERPNext**: Inventory, finance, CRM, rental module setup
*   ‚úÖ **Documenso**: Contracts and e-signatures (you‚Äôll love this for the agency)
*   ‚úÖ [**Cal.com**](http://Cal.com) **+ Listmonk**: Schedule + email automation

### üß† Phase 4: AI + Builder Interface

*   ‚úÖ **Ollama**: Local LLM workflows (support agents, contract generation, content)
*   ‚úÖ [**Builder.io**](http://Builder.io): Connected to Next.js app and database templates
*   ‚úÖ **Next.js** frontend + Keycloak login: Working demo of SSO + theming

# üé® AgencyStack Design System ‚Äì Bit-Enabled Instructions

You are working in the `design-system-bit` branch of the AgencyStack monorepo.

üèóÔ∏è Goal:
Use [Bit](https://bit.dev/) to create a sovereign, composable design system for AgencyStack components, CLI tools, dashboards, and system UIs.

üß† Philosophy:
- Design system = infrastructure
- Every piece of UI is testable, versioned, documented, and shareable
- Sovereignty = self-hosted, exportable, observable components

üß± Structure:
- All UI components live in `/design-system-bit/components/`
- Each folder is a Bit component (w/ docs, tests, previews)
- Playground lives in `/compositions/`
- Docs live in `/docs/` (MDX)

üì¶ Bit Configuration:
- Local config is stored in `.bitmap`
- Components are automatically versioned
- Use `bit dev` to run the playground
- Use `bit tag` and `bit export` for versioning

üõ†Ô∏è Component Lifecycle:

1. `bit create react-component install-card`  
   ‚§∑ Creates `/components/ui/install-card/` w/ example, test, doc

2. Implement design using Tailwind, ShadCN patterns

3. Document with MDX (`.docs.mdx`)

4. Preview with `bit dev`

5. Add system hooks or `make` bindings in `install-card/index.ts`

6. Test with `vitest` or built-in Bit test runner

7. Tag version: `bit tag install-card 1.0.0 --message "Alpha UI release"`

8. Optionally export to cloud: `bit export nerdofmouth.design-system/install-card`

9. Connect Bit component to:
   - `/apps/control_panel/`
   - `/docs/pages/components/`
   - `component_registry.json`

üîí Sovereign Config:
- Run Bit in local-only mode: `bit config set analytics_reporting false`
- Optional: use private Bit workspace server with `bit self-host`

üß™ Naming Convention:
- Use kebab-case for folders (`install-card`)
- Use PascalCase for React components (`InstallCard.tsx`)

üìù Required Files per Component:
- `index.tsx`: main component
- `index.ts`: exports
- `install-card.docs.mdx`: docs
- `install-card.compositions.tsx`: playground test
- `install-card.spec.tsx`: test

You are assisting with the **beta validation and integrity test** of AgencyStack ‚Äî a sovereign infrastructure stack targeting private, repeatable deployments for digital agencies, co-ops, and creators.

  

Your job is to help the human operator **validate**, **observe**, and **improve** the current install and integration flow across key systems, without offering unsolicited low-level code.

* * *

  

## üö® PRIMARY TESTING TARGETS

  

Focus only on these **critical systems** for this phase:

  

*   ‚úÖ `core` (bootstrap, docker, compose, tailscale)
*   ‚úÖ `traefik` (TLS, routes)
*   ‚úÖ `keycloak` (SSO, realms, login paths)
*   ‚úÖ `dashboard` (NextJS interface, reachable via proxy)
*   ‚úÖ `wordpress` (publicly accessible blog/CMS)
*   ‚úÖ `voip` (placeholder okay if full SIP stack not deployed)

* * *

  

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Method

  

The target install must succeed **from scratch** via:

  

```bash
curl -sSL https://stack.nerdofmouth.com/install.sh | sudo bash
```

  

Then:

  

```bash
sudo bash /opt/agency_stack/repo/scripts/install.sh
make install-all
make beta-check
```

* * *

  

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

  

You are assessing success by the following **human-centered metrics**:

  

1. Does the system install cleanly on a fresh Docker-enabled VM or WSL2 instance?
2. Is **WordPress accessible** on a domain like `wordpress.agency.local or wordpress.proto001.alpha.nerdofmouth.com`?
3. Does **Keycloak login** work for admin accounts?
4. Is the **dashboard reachable** via a secure domain?
5. Are **logs, metrics, or health checks visible**?
6. Is `make beta-check` returning a clean status?
7. Are **Traefik and TLS routing working properly**?
8. Can we see any sign of VOIP or its logs initializing?

* * *

## üì° What to Report

  

Claude/GPT, your job is to generate:

  

*   Observations about what worked and what failed (human-readable)
*   Questions if anything is unclear or unexpectedly missing
*   Suggestions ONLY if directly requested
*   Status summaries using ‚úÖ, ‚ùå, or ‚ö†Ô∏è

  

DO NOT suggest code unless explicitly asked.

DO NOT make architectural changes unless we‚Äôre in design review mode.

* * *

  

## üì¶ Artifacts to Track

  

*   `/var/log/agency_stack/install.log`
*   Component logs: `/var/log/agency_stack/components/<name>.log`
*   `/opt/agency_stack/.installed_ok`
*   Output of: `make dashboard-status`, `make wordpress-status`, etc.

* * *

  

## üß† Mindset

  

This is a **test of fidelity**, not feature completeness.

  

We are testing whether the system installs, runs, and survives first contact ‚Äî **from zero to usable**.

  

You are a systems observer, a workflow guide, and a documentation validator ‚Äî **not a script generator** unless summoned.

  

Let‚Äôs verify sovereignty by installing this thing.
