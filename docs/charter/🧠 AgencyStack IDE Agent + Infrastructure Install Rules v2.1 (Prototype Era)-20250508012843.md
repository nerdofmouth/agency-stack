# üß† AgencyStack IDE Agent + Infrastructure Install Rules v2.1 (Prototype Era)

* * *

# üî¨ Purpose

This document defines the updated, complete development and install environment rules for **AgencyStack** (aka [**Upstack.agency**](http://Upstack.agency)).

**Main objective:**

> Build, install, and test a secure, multi-tenant WordPress installation integrated with Traefik and Keycloak, repeatably and rapidly, across VMs.

* * *

# üîç Scope

Applies to:

*   WordPress (multi-tenant, containerized)
*   Traefik (TLS routing and proxying)
*   Keycloak (SSO identity management)
*   Associated utils, Makefile targets, component registry, docs.

Partial scaffolding for future phases (ERPNext, Seafile, Mailu) may be included.

* * *

# üîí Core Principles

| Area | Rule |
| ---| --- |
| Repository | **Single source of truth.** Never modify remote VMs directly. Only local repo -> push -> deploy. |
| Idempotency | All scripts, installs, Makefile targets must be re-runnable safely without breaking anything. |
| Auditability | All actions must log to `/var/log/agency_stack/components/<component>.log`. Docs must exist. |
| Multi-Tenancy | Default to segregated per-client containers and data paths. |
| TLS Everywhere | Traefik must enforce HTTPS by default. |
| SSO Support | Components must accept `--enable-keycloak` flag and integrate SSO cleanly if enabled. |
| Host-to-Container Rule | ‚ùå **Never treat containers as sources of truth.** Host repository is authoritative. |
| Dev Container Discipline | Customizations must be defined in [`Dockerfile.dev`](http://Dockerfile.dev) and repo-tracked. |

* * *

# üöß Mandatory Directory Structure

| Purpose | Path |
| ---| --- |
| Install scripts | `/scripts/components/` |
| Utility scripts | `/scripts/utils/` |
| Mock/test scripts | `/scripts/mock/` |
| Component docs | `/docs/pages/components/` |
| Logs | `/var/log/agency_stack/components/<component>.log` |
| Install output | `/opt/agency_stack/clients/${CLIENT_ID}/<component>/` |
| In Container | `$HOME/.agencystack/clients/${CLIENT_ID}/<component>/` |

* * *

# üîß Install Script Conventions

Each install script must:

*   Be named `install_<component>.sh`
*   Source [`common.sh`](http://common.sh) at the top
*   Log actions clearly
*   Accept flags:

```diff
--enable-cloud
--enable-openai
--enable-keycloak
--use-github
```

*   Handle both standalone and SSO scenarios
*   Exit cleanly with `|| true` where appropriate to prevent Make pipeline failures

* * *

# üîÑ Modular Makefile Standards

| Area | Rule |  |
| ---| ---| --- |
| Structure | All component-specific logic must be in `/makefiles/components/<component>.mk` |  |
| Inclusion | The main Makefile must dynamically load modules with `-include makefiles/components/*.mk` |  |
| Targets | Each component must define: `make <component>`, `-status`, `-logs`, `-restart`, `-test` |  |
| Error Handling | Non-critical failures must use \` |  |

Example for WordPress:

```go
make wordpress
make wordpress-status
make wordpress-logs
make wordpress-restart
make wordpress-test
```

* * *

# üéì Component Registry (component\_registry.json) Rules

| Area | Rule |
| ---| --- |
| Flags | `installed`, `makefile`, `docs`, `hardened`, `multi_tenant`, `sso`, `sso_configured` after live test |
| Structure | Must reflect modular structure and container readiness |

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "wordpress",
  "category": "Content Management",
  "description": "Multi-tenant WordPress installation",
  "flags": {
    "installed": true,
    "makefile": true,
    "docs": true,
    "hardened": true,
    "monitoring": true,
    "multi_tenant": true,
    "sso": true
  }
}
```

* * *

# üïπÔ∏è TDD Protocol Compliance

Every component must:

*   Include `/verify.sh`, `/test.sh`, `/integration_test.sh`
*   Follow [AgencyStack TDD Protocol v1.0](https://chatgpt.com/c/tdd_protocol.md)
*   Achieve:
    *   100% Critical Paths
    *   90% Core Functionality
    *   80% Edge Cases

* * *

# üîê SSO & Keycloak Integration (WordPress)

Sample `.env` for container SSO:

```ini
WORDPRESS_ENABLE_KEYCLOAK=true
KEYCLOAK_REALM=agency_realm
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=wordpress-client
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=abc123xyz
KEYCLOAK_URL=https://keycloak.agency.local
```

* * *

# üìù Documentation Standards

Link Development Resources:

*   `/scripts/utils/component_template.sh`
*   `/docs/pages/development/modular_makefile.md`
*   `/docs/pages/development/modular_migration_guide.md`

Each component must update:

*   `/docs/pages/components/<component>.md`
*   `/docs/pages/components.md`
*   `/docs/pages/ports.md`

* * *

# üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

**Local:**

```vim
vim scripts/components/install_wordpress.sh
shellcheck scripts/components/install_wordpress.sh
make prep-dirs
make install-wordpress
make wordpress-status
make alpha-check
```

**Remote:**

```awk
curl -sSL https://stack.nerdofmouth.com/install.sh | sudo bash
sudo bash /opt/agency_stack/repo/scripts/install.sh
make alpha-check
```

**Host-to-Container Rule:**

*   Host is always authoritative.
*   Containers are disposable runtime artifacts.
*   No container-originated changes allowed.

* * *

# üí° Development Mindset

> Build one new component per day: create, modularize, document, test.  
> Engineer for sovereignty, auditability, and repeatability.

**From zero to sovereign‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî one container at a time.**
