# AgencyStack Integrations

This document provides an overview of integrations between various AgencyStack components, detailing how different services work together to provide a cohesive platform.

## Available Integrations

AgencyStack provides several integration types to connect components:

| Integration Type | Description | Command |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Email** | Connect components to Mailu for email delivery | `make integrate-email` |
| **Single Sign-On** | Unify authentication with Keycloak | `make integrate-sso` |
| **Monitoring** | Centralized logging and metrics with Loki/Grafana | `make integrate-monitoring` |
| **Data Exchange** | Data sharing between WordPress and ERPNext | `make integrate-data-bridge` |
| **All Integrations** | Run all integration types at once | `make integrate-components` |

## Email Integration

The email integration connects AgencyStack components to [Mailu](https://mailu.io), which provides a full-featured mail server with SMTP, IMAP, webmail interface (Roundcube), and admin panel.

### Components Supported

| Component | Integration Details |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **WordPress** | Configures the WP Mail SMTP plugin to use Mailu for all WordPress emails |
| **ERPNext** | Sets up ERPNext to use Mailu for notifications and transactional emails |
| **Future: Listmonk** | Newsletter and mailing list manager integration |
| **Future: Chatwoot** | Support ticket notification emails |

### Configuration

The integration automatically configures:

- SMTP server settings (host, port, encryption)
- Authentication credentials
- Default sender addresses
- Email domain configuration

### Usage

```bash
make integrate-email
```

## Single Sign-On Integration

The Single Sign-On (SSO) integration connects components to [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) for centralized authentication, enabling users to log in once and access all integrated services.

### Components Supported

| Component | Integration Details |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **WordPress** | Uses miniOrange OIDC plugin for WordPress SSO with Keycloak |
| **ERPNext** | Configures OAuth provider settings for Keycloak authentication |
| **Grafana** | Sets up OAuth authentication with Keycloak including role mapping |
| **Future: Others** | Any component supporting OAuth2/OIDC will be added |

### Configuration

The integration automatically configures:

- OAuth client registration
- Endpoint URLs (authorization, token, userinfo)
- Role mapping between Keycloak and applications
- Redirect URIs for proper authentication flow

### Usage

```bash
make integrate-sso
```

## Monitoring Integration

The monitoring integration connects components to [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) for centralized logging and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for visualization, enabling comprehensive observability across all services.

### Components Supported

| Component | Integration Details |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **WordPress** | Sets up log parsing pipeline for WordPress logs |
| **ERPNext** | Configures Loki to collect and parse Frappe/ERPNext logs |
| **Mailu** | Enables mail server log collection and parsing |
| **Grafana** | Creates preconfigured dashboards for all components |
| **Uptime Kuma** | Configures health check endpoints for all services |

### Configuration

The integration automatically configures:

- Loki log collection pipelines for each component
- Log parsing rules for structured logging
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Health check endpoints for uptime monitoring

### Usage

```bash
make integrate-monitoring
```

## Data Exchange Bridge

The data exchange bridge enables bidirectional data sharing between components, starting with WordPress and ERPNext integration to synchronize users, products, orders, and content.

### Components Supported

| Component Pair | Integration Details |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **WordPress â†” ERPNext** | Bidirectional sync of users, products, orders, and contact forms |

### Configuration

The integration automatically configures:

- WordPress plugin for ERPNext connectivity
- ERPNext app for WordPress integration
- API endpoints for data exchange
- Configuration UI for controlling what data is shared

### Usage

```bash
make integrate-data-bridge
```

## Integration State Management

AgencyStack maintains records of applied integrations in `/opt/agency_stack/integrations/state/`, enabling:

- **Idempotent operations**: Running an integration multiple times won't break anything
- **Status tracking**: See which integrations have been applied and when
- **Version management**: Track integration versions and updates

## Extending Integrations

Integrations can be extended by modifying the relevant scripts in the `scripts/integration` directory. Each integration type has its own module, making it easy to add support for new components or enhance existing integrations.

## Troubleshooting

If an integration fails or you need to debug issues:

1. Check the integration logs in `/var/log/agency_stack/`
2. Run with `--auto` flag for non-interactive mode: `sudo make integrate-components -- --auto`
3. View the integration state files in `/opt/agency_stack/integrations/state/`

## Best Practices

1. **Run integrations after installation**: Always run the appropriate integration after installing new components
2. **Keep components updated**: Ensure all components are up-to-date before running integrations
3. **Check integration versions**: Re-run integrations after major version updates
4. **Use specific integration types**: Use targeted integration commands rather than running all integrations at once
