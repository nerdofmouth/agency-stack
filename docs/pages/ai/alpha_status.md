## Integration Status

### Component API Connectivity

| From | To | Status | Notes |
|------|---|--------|-------|
| AI Dashboard | Ollama | | Model management and inference |
| AI Dashboard | LangChain | | Prompt engineering interface |
| Agent Orchestrator | Ollama | | Model inference for recommendations |
| Agent Orchestrator | LangChain | | Advanced processing and chaining |
| Resource Watcher | Agent Orchestrator | | Resource monitoring data integration |
| Agent Tools Bridge | Agent Orchestrator | | Recommendations and actions API |
| Agent Tools Bridge | LangChain | | Prompt testing functionality |

### Monitoring Integration

All components expose:
- Prometheus metrics
- Loki log aggregation
- Health check endpoints

### Multi-tenant Support

All components support:
- Client ID segmentation
- Isolated configuration per client
- Proper Docker networking isolation

## Mock Mode Test Harness

The AI Suite includes a comprehensive mock mode test harness that allows:

- Testing the interaction between all AI components without real data
- Simulating various events (high memory usage, slow responses, errors)
- Validating UI components and workflows in a controlled environment
- Training users without affecting production systems

The test harness can be started with `make ai-suite-test` and provides simulated:
- Agent Orchestrator responses
- LangChain LLM interactions
- Resource Watcher metrics and logs
- Agent Tools UI interface

For more details on the mock environment, see [Mock Mode Documentation](./mock_mode.md).

## Known Issues

1. **Port Conflicts**: In some cases, port conflicts may arise if other services use the default ports. Use `make detect-ports` to identify and resolve.

2. **Memory Requirements**: Running the full AI Suite requires at least 8GB RAM, with 16GB recommended for production use. 

3. **Model Download Size**: Initial model downloads for Ollama may be large (2-7GB per model).

## Alpha Testing Procedure

To perform a full Alpha validation, follow these steps:

1. Start with a fresh VM or host
2. Run the full installation script:
   ```bash
   make install-ai-suite
   ```
3. Verify installation status:
   ```bash
   make ai-alpha-check
   ```
4. Access each component via its web interface or API endpoint
5. Run the full test suite:
   ```bash
   # For each component
   make <component>-test
   ```

## Next Steps for Beta

1. Complete SSO integration across all components
2. Enhance error handling and recovery
3. Add more comprehensive logging
4. Implement fine-grained access control
5. Performance optimization for resource utilization

## Conclusion

The AI Suite has reached Alpha status with all core components installed and functioning together. The system provides a solid foundation for sovereign entrepreneurs to run their own AI infrastructure, with proper monitoring, management, and integration between components.

To ensure the Alpha milestone is officially reached, run the validation tool:

```bash
make ai-alpha-check
```

## Prometheus Metrics

The following metrics are exposed by AI components for monitoring:

| Component | Endpoint | Key Metrics |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Ollama | :11435/metrics | model_load_time, inference_latency, token_throughput |
| LangChain | :5112/metrics | chain_execution_time, memory_usage, api_calls |
| Resource Watcher | :5221/metrics | gpu_utilization, cpu_usage, ram_usage, api_latency |
| Agent Orchestrator | :5211/metrics | agent_runs, task_completion_time, error_rate |

## Mock Mode Support

The AI Suite includes a Mock Mode feature for testing without loading actual models:

- Enable: `make ai-mock-mode`
- Disable: `make ai-mock-mode-disable`
- Status: Indicated in `make ai-alpha-check` output

Mock Mode allows:
- Testing UI workflows without model overhead
- Developing with minimal resources
- Simulating responses for integration testing

## Makefile Targets

Each AI component follows the standardized AgencyStack target pattern:

| Component | Install | Status | Logs | Restart |
|-----------|---------|--------|------|---------|
| Ollama | `make ollama` | `make ollama-status` | `make ollama-logs` | `make ollama-restart` |
| LangChain | `make langchain` | `make langchain-status` | `make langchain-logs` | `make langchain-restart` |
| AI Dashboard | `make ai-dashboard` | `make ai-dashboard-status` | `make ai-dashboard-logs` | `make ai-dashboard-restart` |
| Agent Orchestrator | `make agent-orchestrator` | `make agent-orchestrator-status` | `make agent-orchestrator-logs` | `make agent-orchestrator-restart` |
| Resource Watcher | `make resource-watcher` | `make resource-watcher-status` | `make resource-watcher-logs` | `make resource-watcher-restart` |
| Agent Tools | `make ai-agent-tools` | `make agent-tools-status` | `make agent-tools-logs` | `make agent-tools-restart` |

Complete AI Suite:
- Install: `make install-ai-suite`
- Status: `make ai-suite-status`
- Validation: `make ai-alpha-check`

## Validation

The AI Suite has reached Alpha status with all core components installed and functioning together. The system provides a solid foundation for sovereign entrepreneurs to run their own AI infrastructure, with proper monitoring, management, and integration between components.

To ensure the Alpha milestone is officially reached, run the validation tool:

```bash
make ai-alpha-check
```

This command performs a comprehensive check of all AI components, verifying installation status, API accessibility, Prometheus metrics configuration, and dashboard integration.
