## Integration Status

### Component API Connectivity

| From | To | Status | Notes |
|------|---|--------|-------|
| AI Dashboard | Ollama | ✅ | Model management and inference |
| AI Dashboard | LangChain | ✅ | Prompt engineering interface |
| Agent Orchestrator | Ollama | ✅ | Model inference for recommendations |
| Agent Orchestrator | LangChain | ✅ | Advanced processing and chaining |
| Resource Watcher | Agent Orchestrator | ✅ | Resource monitoring data integration |
| Agent Tools Bridge | Agent Orchestrator | ✅ | Recommendations and actions API |
| Agent Tools Bridge | LangChain | ✅ | Prompt testing functionality |

### Monitoring Integration

All components expose:
- ✅ Prometheus metrics
- ✅ Loki log aggregation
- ✅ Health check endpoints

### Multi-tenant Support

All components support:
- ✅ Client ID segmentation
- ✅ Isolated configuration per client
- ✅ Proper Docker networking isolation

## Known Issues

1. **Port Conflicts**: In some cases, port conflicts may arise if other services use the default ports. Use `make detect-ports` to identify and resolve.

2. **Memory Requirements**: Running the full AI Suite requires at least 8GB RAM, with 16GB recommended for production use. 

3. **Model Download Size**: Initial model downloads for Ollama may be large (2-7GB per model).

## Alpha Testing Procedure

To perform a full Alpha validation, follow these steps:

1. Start with a fresh VM or host
2. Run the full installation script:
   ```bash
   make install-ai-suite
   ```
3. Verify installation status:
   ```bash
   make ai-alpha-check
   ```
4. Access each component via its web interface or API endpoint
5. Run the full test suite:
   ```bash
   # For each component
   make <component>-test
   ```

## Next Steps for Beta

1. Complete SSO integration across all components
2. Enhance error handling and recovery
3. Add more comprehensive logging
4. Implement fine-grained access control
5. Performance optimization for resource utilization

## Conclusion

The AI Suite has reached Alpha status with all core components installed and functioning together. The system provides a solid foundation for sovereign entrepreneurs to run their own AI infrastructure, with proper monitoring, management, and integration between components.

To ensure the Alpha milestone is officially reached, run the validation tool:

```bash
make ai-alpha-check
```
