# Configuration Guide

This guide provides information on how to configure the FOSS server stack for different environments and requirements.

## Environment Configuration

Before running the installation scripts, you may need to customize certain aspects for your specific environment.

### Domain Configuration

Many services in the stack rely on proper domain name configuration. For a production environment:

1. Register a domain name if you don't already have one
2. Set up DNS records to point to your server's IP address
3. Consider using subdomains for different services (e.g., `erp.yourdomain.com`, `wordpress.yourdomain.com`)

### Port Configuration

The stack uses various ports for different services. Ensure these ports are accessible and not blocked by firewalls:

- 80/443: HTTP/HTTPS for web services (Traefik)
- 9443: Portainer management interface
- Additional ports as required by specific services

## Service-Specific Configuration

### Traefik

Create or modify configuration files in the `traefik` directory:

1. Set your domain name in the configuration
2. Configure SSL certificate generation
3. Adjust routing rules for your services

### Docker Compose

If adding new services or modifying existing ones:

1. Create or modify docker-compose files in the respective service directories
2. Ensure all services are on the same Docker network for internal communication
3. Set appropriate environment variables for each service

## System Sizing Recommendations

| Stack Size | RAM | CPU | Storage | Suitable For |
|------------|-----|-----|---------|-------------|
| Minimal | 4GB | 2 cores | 30GB | Testing, development |
| Standard | 8GB | 4 cores | 100GB | Small team, basic usage |
| Professional | 16GB | 8 cores | 500GB | Medium business, multiple teams |
| Enterprise | 32GB+ | 16+ cores | 1TB+ | Large organization, high traffic |

## Scaling Considerations

For larger deployments:

1. Consider splitting services across multiple servers
2. Implement proper database backup and replication
3. Set up monitoring and alerting for system resources
4. Plan for high availability where needed

## Security Recommendations

1. Change default passwords for all services immediately after installation
2. Regularly update all components using their respective update procedures
3. Implement network segmentation and access controls
4. Use a VPN for accessing administrative interfaces
5. Enable two-factor authentication where available
6. Regularly backup all data and configurations
